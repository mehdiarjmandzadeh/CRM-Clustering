This project is a K-Means Clustering Visualizer for CRM data.  
To run the program, download the executable file (`K-means-CRM.exe`) from the Releases section and place it in the same folder as the data file `CRM_CustomerDataset.csv`.  
Running the exe will generate a chart showing the clustered CRM data.
